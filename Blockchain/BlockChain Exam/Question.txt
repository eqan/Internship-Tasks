Make an ERC20 token contract. The token will have a capped supply of 100M. 10M will be pre minted. The other 90M will be minted anytime by the owner of contract. We have to sell these tokens for some price. The initial price of token will be 0.00001 ETH. Owner of contract can change price anytime. Owner will be able to withdraw the eth amount. Whenever user will buy tokens it will charge some fee from buy amount. The initial fee is 0.1%. But the owner of contract can change the fee anytime. Write proper tests for every function.
