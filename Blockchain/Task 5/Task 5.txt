Q 
Tokenization of real estate -> If shares are tokenized then how??
Adding a block requires us to go from starting node to the end node and then inserting the new block, similar to the concept of linkedList the question is doesnt it requires us to traverse millions of blocks just to add new information to the ledger? Isnt this a slow cumbersome process? Has the concept of blockchain evolved enough to resolve this issue?
