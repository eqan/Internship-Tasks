    Create a smart contract, send and withdraw ethers.
    All you need to know is PAYABLE.
    A function needs to be of the payable type in order to be able to receive ethers.
    What if the function isnâ€™t payable? It will sadly refuse to accept the ethers and the
    transaction will be reverted. Want the contract to accept Ethers no matter what?
    Fallback functions make it possible
    You can send ethers by simply exploring this awesome Article and learn about the
    different ways to handle this case!
